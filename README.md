# islandGen2
A simple python script for randomly generating semi-realistic maps of tropical islands 

This is super simple for now, I have plans to add extra layers of noise in order to diversify the generated islands and allow the end user more parameters to tune.

Below is an unflitered sampling of generated islands.
